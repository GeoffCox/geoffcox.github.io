Software is complex; great code requires thoughtful and patient determination; successful collaboration is strenuous; and humans have to stop to refuel and recharge.

## 3 things per day
Like almost all developers, I have an infinite list of things to get done. I can't get them all done in a day, so I have to choose. If a deliberate choice isn't made, then the choice will be made by the crisis of the day. 

Every morning, I choose three tasks for the day. I make the conscious decision to ignore the remaining ocean of work. Any day when I complete my three tasks, I mentally congratulate myself. I would never pick up a fourth task unless all three were done early in the day (this has never happened anyway). If I don't get them done, I forgive myself and commit to do a little better tomorrow.

It is disturbingly easy to choose three tasks that are interesting, fun, and achievable in a day. This would starve out the important work that challenges me to grow. I don't choose the most horrible tasks every day either.

I choose the most important, difficult, and urgent task first. I often try to find the one that I most want to procrastinate doing; the one that puts a few butterflies in my stomach. Maybe it is blocked and requires a difficult conversation. Maybe there is existing spaghetti code. Maybe there is a deadline and I'm not sure that I can get it done in time. Maybe it is just really tedious and boring. It does need to be done though, and making progress on it always makes me feel better.

My second task must also be important, but does not have to be as urgent nor difficult. It should be straightforward and likely achievable in a day. This is my fallback task if I get blocked on my primary task. This task increases my chances of getting at least one thing done if my day goes sideways.

My third task is my dessert task. I choose one where I'm likely to learn something new, have a great time working on it, get to work with someone I like, or that builds on previous work.

I often figure out my 3 things as I get ready in the morning or right after my first cup of coffee. I either write them down or repeat them to myself through the day like Arya Stark's hit list. It charges me up for the day and helps me feel in control of my destiny. For me, it is the most important key to productivity.
