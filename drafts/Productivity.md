Software is complex; great code requires thoughtful and patient determination; successful collaboration is strenuous; and humans have to stop to refuel and recharge.

## 3 things per day

Each morning, choose three tasks. You can do this as you get ready in the morning, over your first coffee, or as you commute to work. You can write them down or repeat them to yourself throughout the day like Arya Stark's hit list.

Ignore the remaining ocean of work. You should feel great if you complete all three. If you don't, forgive yourself, consider why things went sideways, and try again tomorrow.

For the first task, choose the most important task. Prefer the more difficult or urgent task: the one that puts some butterflies in your stomach. Maybe there is a tough deadline, you need help to get unblocked, or there is existing spaghetti code to unravel. Imagine how great you will feel once it is done. Avoid 'low hanging fruit'. That is a path to appearing productive but not getting meaningful results.

For task number two, choose another that is important. This one shouldn't be difficult nor urgent. It should be straightforward and likely achievable in a day. This is your fallback task if you get stuck on the first one. It increases your chances of getting at least one thing done each day.

For the last task, choose a dessert task. Something that you are excited to work on. This task should be one where you learn something interesting, have a great time working on it, get to work with someone you like, or that builds on previous work. It is your reward for getting the tough tasks done and should charge you up for tomorrow.

Deciding your priorities will help you feel control of your destiny and help avoid interruption and distraction.

## Plan each week in solitude

Take 30 minutes on Monday, alone, to frame your week. Think of your available time like money you're going to spend. Where should you spend your money to get the most value? Decide for yourself and you will naturally get more done.

Pick a theme for the week. For example, make progress on a feature, fix a slew of bugs, delete technical debt, or help customers. If your team process has a theme for the current sprint, consider if your theme aligns.

Next, review your calendar. Figure out which meetings you will or won't attend. If people tend to fill up any of your available time, schedule appointments with yourself to get work done. Look for blocks of sufficient duration that you can get into the flow.

When you find that you have a fragmented schedule or too many back-to-back meetings, don't try to work during those meetings. Instead, be present and participate at the those meetings; your coworkers will appreciate it. Constantly context switching between code and meetings ruins productivity.

Skim over your pool of tasks to identify candidates for your 3 things per day. If you are overwhelmed by too many top priority must-do tasks, list what you can say yes to and what you are going to say no (or not yet) to.

Avoid stepping on the treadmill of infinite work. At the end of the week, you should feel done. Hopefully, you feel this way at the end of each day. When work doesn't bleed over into your personal time, you get to recharge and processes events. Weekly and daily boundaries are critical to avoiding burnout.
