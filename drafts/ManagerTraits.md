## Reasons I should be a manager

- I listen to each team member.
- I foster team productivity.
- I am a process minimalist and love experimenting with better ways to work.
- I care about each person's career and happiness.
- I am a kind and polite person.
- I am introspective. I blame myself before others.
- I give others the benefit of the doubt. I recognize people's growth and don't pidgin-hole them.
- I am a great coach and mentor.
- I am a great teacher of software architecture, coding best practices, and technology.
- I set and demonstrate very high standards for quality and professionalism.
- I am a pessimist when estimating software.
- I am calm and pragmatic in time of crisis.
- I am trustworthy and brave in tough situations.
- I enjoy handling the grunt work so that my team get the fun and important tasks.

## Reasons I shouldn't be a manager

- I hate group meetings. They are too long, have too many people, lack a useful agenda, and are almost always boring and irrelevant.
- I don't like personal conflict. I avoid it and pay a heavy personal tax to face or circumvent it.
- I loathe judging people to determine their individual rewards.
- I am always weighing my time doing management chores against getting to do what I love: architect adn write code.
- I am terrible at politics. I naively assume good intentions, can be too open and honest, and am easily outmaneuvered by bad actors.
- I am very problem focused. This makes me a poor cheerleader and dismal celebration event host.
- I cannot find passion for managing, coaching, or teaching people that are not self-motivated to learn and improve.
- I am a shy introvert. This can inhibit being recognized as a leader, ensuring team's work is visible and valued, and being heard in meetings full of interrupters.
- I spend my focus on juggling all the decisions in the code. Too many non-technical problems at once overwhelm me.
- I always want to be prepared and don't like surprises.
- I won't parrot a message down to my team when I don't agree with my management.
- I am not great at networking. I don't easily remember people, often forget past conversation details, and struggle to maintain relationships.

## Auxiliary considerations

- Being a dev lead gets me a seat at the table for architecture and technology decisions
- I don't think the position of manager should exist - it should be different people in different roles: architect, process owner, product owner, performance observer, recruiter & morale owner, etc.
- I have resting 'judgy face'. People who don't know me well assume I am very critical and don't think well of them.
