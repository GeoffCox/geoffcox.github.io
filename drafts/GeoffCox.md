I have been a professional software developer for over 25 years. I'm an expert in web development (10 years) and C#/.NET development (20 years). I have previous deep expertise in C++ development (7 years). I love designing and writing code to solve tough problems.

I have studied software architecture, design patterns, and software development approaches across a wide variety of system domains and technology stacks. One of my talents is refactoring and engineering a codebase into a well architected system.

I enjoy designing user interfaces and exploring how information visualization, layout geometries, and interaction sequences can create an engaging user experience.

I gravitate toward building applications, components, and command-line tools for developers that help them be more productive.

## What are your top skills? (what are you good at)

I'm an expert in web development (10 years) and C#/.NET developer (20 years). I have previous expertise in C++ (10 years).

I have developed globally available, production web applications and web APIs in Typescript/Javascript. I have created sophisticated UIs with React, Angular, Knockout, and jQuery; built analytics experiences using D3; and leverged MobX, Redux, and Recoil for state management. I have also developed electron client apps and node web APIs. I am well versed in web toolchains including webpack, jest, and CSS-in-JS libraries. I have recently been learning Svelte and rollup.

I have built globally available, production web sites in C#/.NET using ASP.NET MVC and Web API; created client applications in WPF, Silverlight, and WinForms; and developed Visual Studio plug-ins, NT services, big-data ETL pipelines, and
command-line developer tools.

I have studied and applied software architecture, design patterns, and software development approaches across many different systems and technology stacks. One of my _superpowers_ is transforming and refactoring existing software into properly architected systems. One aspect of my talent is finding the right name for concepts and parts that support the architecture.
