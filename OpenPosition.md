I'm hiring for one of the best jobs at Microsoft.  I've had a lot of experience inside and outside Microsoft (startups, contracting, consulting, full time) and worked with most groups at Microsoft.  I can tell you that the group I'm in right now is wonderful; full of wonderful people and poised to accomplish some seriously amazing things.

My team is amazing.  We take the time to thoughtfully solve tough problems while delivering valuable innovations to product teams.  Everyone on the team is talented, is driven to get things done, helps each other succeed, and is kind and considerate.

It is an rare opportunity for a junior web developer. 
I want someone with a creative spark that can think about problems from new angles and is willing to voice their ideas.

I'm looking for someone :
* who loves web development
* wants to make a difference
* craves learning from some of the best developers and researchers
* and values building innovative UI.  

I need your help!  It is hard to find the right person for this job.  I'm not looking for a backend developer who dabbles in web UI.  I'm not looking for someone that slaps together whatever npm libraries are the most popular.  I'm not looking for someone who wants to rinse-and-repeat the same old design.  I'm not looking for someone happy just fixing one bug after another. 

I am looking for someone who is ready to grow into a great web developer and is talented and tenacious enough to take on the challenge. 

If you know this person, please have them apply here: https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/job/622724

I expect the right candidate will want to make sure I fit the bill as their manager and development lead.  You can point them here: https://geoffcox.github.io/Management to learn my management tenets.

Thanks!

Geoff
