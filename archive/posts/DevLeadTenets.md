# 3 tenets for leading software development teams

These are the tenets that guide me as a software development lead.

## Empower developers through ownership

Writing good code takes creativity and discipline. There is something special about having crafted something entirely yours. It doesn't matter if it is an entire product, one module, or just one function. Developers love to proudly point at their code and have it appreciated.

Don't get me wrong. I don't think developers should work in complete isolation. Collaboration can be a great productivity amplifier, but it can also dilute the sense of personal achievement. Too much wild collaboration where everyone parties all over the source code can cause other problems. It can be difficult to distinguish who contributed what. Estimates made by one dev are hard to apply when others end up doing the work. Worst of all, it can cause the [bystander effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect).

Give each developer something they own, where they make the decisions, and where they are accountable. It makes measuring contribution straightforward. It lets you coach each individual in the specifics of their work. It encourages developers to try new things and show them to the rest of the team. It builds strong team loyalty because you treat them as you want to be treated.

## Minimize process

Smart, talented, self-motivated people don't need strict process nor authoritarian management. All they need is just enough process to create shared understanding, build a team culture, and coordinate work. When process is done right, people won't even know its there.

Take time to discover and delete unnecessary process. Invest in automating away manual drudgery. In retrospectives and 1:1 meetings, ask developers what is getting in their way. There is likely some process nonsense or inadequate tooling that is hurting productivity or making someone's job less pleasant.

When something goes wrong, some will ask or demand for more process to safeguard the future. Don't layer on more process before you reach out to your team to brainstorm ideas. You will be amazed by how innovative developers can be helping keep the process minimal.

Be the human shield from endless meetings, status reports, and form filling. Be willing to change process as the demands on the team change. Change up who does what as people demonstrate and grow their abilities.

## Lead by example

Good developers have a strong sense of logic and fairness. They resent being asked to put in extra hours if their manager isn't willing to commit equally.

Keep your coding skills sharp. Leading through technical knowledge goes farther than spending manager/employee authority. It will help ask the right planning/feature/technology questions to generate clarity for your team as well as properly appreciate your developers' work.  You will have a much easier time weathering tough times and conflict by building mutual technical respect.

Take on the less glamourous tasks to allow your developers to apply their big brains to the critical path. Developers will be motivated knowing you are willing to slog through tedious tasks, be self-disciplined writing quality code, and to only ask what you are also willing to do.
