The traditional resume format is terrible: 

Experience is listed in reverse-chronological order. It implies that your recent work is the most important and applicable to the job; a ridiculous notion. Candidates are looking for a new job, not the exact same job they just had. The formative lessons candidates learn that make them great happen early to mid-career, not always in the last job they had.
Reverse-chronological order also creates a 'but what have you done lately' bias. 

A well written news article should list the most important information first and then cover the details. Journalists refer to this as the inverted pyramid.






The problems with resumes
- Chronological != Most important (inverted pyramid)
- Company focused != Experience focused
- Skill word cloud != Real expertise and != trust
- Abbreviated format != personal tone
- Resume length != complete story
