# Get a Profesional Fit

Getting a professional bike fit is an absolute must if you bike more than a few miles per day average. I watched every YouTube video I could on how to properly set my saddle height, plum- bob to get my pedal position right, and measure to get the proper reach. Yet I still got most of it wrong.

The human body is quite adaptable - especially to slightly incorrect bike fit. When I was out there exercising on a poorly fit bike, I started strengthening the wrong muscle groups as my body compensated. I thought I have a comfortable fit because my body adapted, but I was making myself work nearly twice as hard to keep up with my riding buddies and go up those steeper hills.

The professional fit I had done (at Edge and Spoke in Redmond WA) used the Retul/Specialized system which uses a steroscopic vision system (like XBOX Kinect) to watch how your body moves as you pedal. Analyzing the dynamics of your riding is vastly better than eyeballing things and hoping it works out. My fit got my knees aligned properly which stopped extra lateral knee movement and minimized pronation (when the knee moves inward as the arch of the foot flattens out). This gave me more power, less fatigue during rides, and remove pain post-ride. Plus, I now have the measurements to get any bike set up correctly.

Another advantage to professional fitting is they can recommend swapping out different parts - different stem lengths and angles, shims in shoes, stack height on cleats, wider/narrow handlebars, better saddle for your riding position and body geometry, etc. If you are only tuning the equipment you have, you might never be able to get an optimal fit.

Bike shops often say they provide a fitting as part of buying a new bike. Most shops mean they will eyeball your seat height, and check that your reach isn't way off. This isn't a true professional fit. Good shops will help you tune your fit over time, still not a professional fit.  Professional fitters are actually trained (and certified by their fitting tool company) to fit a bike correctly.

If you are going to be a cyclist, you're probably spending several thousand on the bike and equipment. Professional fits only run a couple of hundred dollars. Well worth the cost given the benefit of making all the other purchases work better for you.

Finally, I learned a lot about different bike adjustments as part of my fitting. I understand how the seat height effects the setback and cleat position. I know that getting the seat position is the key to power and pain-free riding while the bar reach is more of a comfort vs. aerodynamics decision. I learned that road cleats have a lot more adjustment ability to control knee angles than mountain cleats. Overall, it was worth several times the cost.
