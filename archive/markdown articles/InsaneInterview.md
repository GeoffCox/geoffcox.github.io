# Insane Interview

I've probably interviewed over a hundred people in my career.  Candidates varied from great to bad to strange, but this interview was ***pants-on-head crazy***.

## Background

I was asked to interview a potential college hire for a software developer position at Microsoft.  This was a typical hour-long interview and I had my range of questions good for just-out-of-college candidates. He came recommended through someone I worked with in a previous group. I read through his resume which contained a solid GPA from a decent school, a list of programming languages he knew, and the short summary about how he'd love to work for a company that makes great software - pretty standard.

## The Interview

Here's an account of the interview.  My thoughts are in parenthesis, actions in brackets.

**Me**: Hi, I'm Geo....

**Him**: [interrupting me] Oh I'm [redacted] and so excited to be interviewed by someone of your caliber.  I'm in awe of your experience and abilities.  I'm sure I will gain a lot of wisdom just getting to be near you today.

**Me**: Uh..OK. (Weird, why is he laying it on this thick? Who knows maybe he's nervous.)

**Me**: Alright, I see you have been working with C#.  I'm going to start by asking some basic C# questions and I'll get harder until you can't answer.  First, can you tell me what public, protected, and private mean?

**Him**: Sure. Well. Uh. I've never actually used C#.

**Me**: Oh...It lists C# on your resume here under expertise. 

**Him**: Yeah. Those items are aspirations more than experience. I hope I get the chance to work with those someday.

**Me**: What programming language do you know from school?

**Him**: We didn't really get into that.

**Me**: (Wow. Oh, he doesn't have a CS degree.  Maybe I'll take a different approach here.)  Tell me about what you are interested in doing here at Microsoft.  What about software development excites you?  What kind of problems do you want to solve?

**Him**: I'm really interested in business meetings.  

**Me**: (Oh god....) What do you mean?

**Him**: I'd like to be the director of a group.  Tell people what to do.  You know...business stuff.

**Me**: (Holy mackerel. Seriously?)

**Him**: I'm sure someone of your stature is in charge of a bunch of people, right? You set the business strategy and then....

**Me**: [now I interrupt him]  I'm a software developer.  How about instead I'll ask you some program management questions instead of developer questions?  (Maybe he is in the wrong loop and should be interviewing for a program manager position?)

**Me**: Imagine you need to know how many taxi cabs there are in the greater Seattle area.  What are some ways you could figure that out? 

**Him**: I could Google it.

**Me**: Well, that's not really the point.  I want to understand what other kinds of information would help you approximate the number.

**Him**: No really.  I have my laptop.  I could Google it. [He pulls out laptop]

**Me**: (Am I on a prank show?) OK. Here's the thing.  Just looking up the answer isn't what I'm asking for.  And as a small point, if you are interviewing at Microsoft, maybe saying you would Bing it might be better than naming a competitor's product. [I grin at him.  Hoping he'll see the humor.]

**Him**: [Opens his laptop and logs in] Well Google is way better, here let me show you.

**Me**: Awww..that's OK.  Hey, I'm going to step out into the hall for a second.

**Him**: Sure.  It's been awesome.

**Me**: [I never return and instead got the next person to terminate the loop.]

**Me**: (Did that really just happen?  Yes it did...sigh.) [Shakes head sadly for rest of day.]
