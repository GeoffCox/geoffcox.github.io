		<p>I am more productive. Writing HTML, CSS, and JS is straigtforward. Svelte&#39;s hot-module-reloading
			makes my inner dev loop very fast. I feel like I can code anything with Svelte.</p> <p>I can properly architect and design. Svelte provides componentization, encapsulation, composition,
			and extensibility.</p> <p>I don&#39;t have to make as many low-level decisions. I don&#39;t agonize over which state management,
			templating, or styling libraries to choose. Svelte meets all my needs for building applications
			and libraries.</p> <p>I don&#39;t waste time trying to optimize my code by hand. There&#39;s no need call optimization
			memo functions since the Svelte compiler makes the code as fast and small.</p> <p>I quickly became an expert. Svelte&#39;s documentation is concise and precise. The tutorial
			and examples get you started in a couple of hours. Addtional capabilities like SvelteKit are built
			on top of rather than inside Svelte. This helps Svelte avoid collapsing under the weight of additional
			complexity.</p> <p>Even if you are a React or Angular fanatic, I hope you&#39;ll check out Svelte. I&#39;ve found that
			learning new languages and technologies helps me be better with the ones I know.</p></div>`;return{c(){e=d("div"),e.innerHTML=i,this.h()},l(t){e=c(t,"DIV",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),p(e)!=="svelte-i097em"&&(e.innerHTML=i),this.h()},h(){v(e,"class","root")},m(t,s){h(t,e,s)},p:a,i:a,o:a,d(t){t&&m(e)}}}class y extends l{constructor(e){super(),r(this,e,null,u,o,{})}}export{y as component};
