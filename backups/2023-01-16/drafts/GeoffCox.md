# Tell me about yourself
I am a talented, dedicated, and experienced professional software developer; a thoughtful technical leader; a skilled architect; and a kind coach. I am full-stack expert in modern web development (10 years) and C#/.NET (20 years). I have significant previous expertise in C++ (7 years). 

I am passionate about software architecture, user interface design, crafting resuable components, and developer tools. One of my top abilities is refactoring and transforming an existing codebase into a well architected system that enables developer productivity.

# Tell me about your top 3 accomplishments
As a dev lead for Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN), we rewrote the entire front-end. It was a tough undertaking. We needed to convert from ASP.NET forms to MVC 1.0 which was a release candidate at the time, support new Visual Studio integration features, and produce both an completely refreshed UI along with a low bandwidth version for developers with limited internet. 

# Tell me about your work history

I have shipped large web applications and web API services, rich client applications, big-data ETL pipelines, as well as analytics, content management, and engineering systems.

I have been a professional software developer for over 25 years. I'm an expert in web development (10 years) and C#/.NET development (20 years). I have previous deep expertise in C++ development (7 years). I love designing and writing code to solve tough problems.

I have studied software architecture, design patterns, and software development approaches across a wide variety of system domains and technology stacks. One of my talents is refactoring and engineering a codebase into a well architected system.

I enjoy designing user interfaces and exploring how information visualization, layout geometries, and interaction sequences can create an engaging user experience.

I gravitate toward building applications, components, and command-line tools for developers that help them be more productive.

## What are your top skills? (what are you good at)

I'm an expert in web development (10 years) and C#/.NET developer (20 years). I have previous expertise in C++ (10 years).

I have developed globally available, production web applications and web APIs in Typescript/Javascript. I have created sophisticated UIs with React, Angular, Knockout, and jQuery; built analytics experiences using D3; and leverged MobX, Redux, and Recoil for state management. I have also developed electron client apps and node web APIs. I am well versed in web toolchains including webpack, jest, and CSS-in-JS libraries. I have recently been learning Svelte and rollup.

I have built globally available, production web sites in C#/.NET using ASP.NET MVC and Web API; created client applications in WPF, Silverlight, and WinForms; and developed Visual Studio plug-ins, NT services, big-data ETL pipelines, and
command-line developer tools.

I have studied and applied software architecture, design patterns, and software development approaches across many different systems and technology stacks. One of my _superpowers_ is transforming and refactoring existing software into properly architected systems. One aspect of my talent is finding the right name for concepts and parts that support the architecture.
